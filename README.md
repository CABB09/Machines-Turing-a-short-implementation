# Machines-Turing-a-short-implementation
This project had the purpose of printing all the instructions of the given Turing machines, using only the decimal number of each machine.

Throughout the project, the instructions were embellished so that they looked good, like the dictionaries that I put. Finally, an attempt was made to apply a Turing machine to modify it, given a finite tape. A pdf is left for more information.
This project was done in the subject of "Computability" of the master's degree course in Artificial Intelligence at the Universidad Veracruzana.
